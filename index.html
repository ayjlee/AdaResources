      Welcome to the Ada Developers Academy past and present student community! This is a collection of resources that Adies created or found to be helpful during their time at Ada. We each experience, learn, and grow a lot as we go through the program and enter the tech industry. This is meant to be a place where we can share the lessons learned and resources we found helpful with each other. Whether you are just entering your Ada internship, are looking for your first post-Ada job, or are continuing your professional development, we hope you can find something here to help you along.

      <!-- TODO: Temporary repo until prototype is done, update to official github repo once we start building the actual site.-->
      <!-- TODO:  Also find a good contact mechanism and replace the fake contact email address. Who owns this?  -->
      <!-- TODO: Add community guidelines and/or "How to contribute" FAQ -->
      Contributions to the resources are most welcome and encouraged. Feel free to make any changes and submit a pull request to the repo here:
